# dai-online-tech-assessments

Welcome to the Data & AI teams' online technical interview - thanks for taking the time!

This challenge aims to highlight a few different areas of your technical skillset. We'll be looking for:

    Collaborative communication and problem-solving (soft skills)
    Proficiency and prowess with your programming environment (medium skills)
    The ability to break down and implement a solution to the problem (hard skills)

## Challenge

As a part of the Agent Experiences (AXT) team, you've been tasked to implement a function that summarises
sentiments received in a series of call events.

    We've stubbed out a function within the sentiment.py file.
    We've written some basic unit tests in the test_sentiment.py file.

You can use Google etc. to look up any Python / library API documentation.

**NOTE:** We do not expect you to implement an optimal solution, nor do we
expect you to come up with a complete solution within the time frame.
Implementing a naive solution that can be easily communicated.
